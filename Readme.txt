aws-iot-temp-sensor
📝 Description
This project simulates an AWS IoT temperature sensor. While it lacks a traditional description or specified tech stack in the original prompt, its implied function suggests the use of AWS IoT services alongside common technologies for sensor data simulation and transmission. Key features would likely include generating simulated temperature readings, publishing these readings to the AWS IoT platform, and potentially integrating with other AWS services for data storage, analysis, and visualization. The tech stack would realistically involve Python for the simulation script, the AWS IoT Device SDK for communication, and potentially services like AWS Lambda, DynamoDB, S3, and QuickSight for a more comprehensive IoT solution.
